/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Center of Madniverse" application. 
 *  "Center of Madniverse" is a text-based adventure game.  Users 
 *  can walk around some scenery (the chamber created by a quantum computer), collect items, throw items, ingest items, and do various challenges.
 *  The object of the game is to destroy the quantum computer by which the player finds himself trapped.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms and items, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
